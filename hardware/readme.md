## Removing Kinova KG-2 Distal Phalanxes
The distal phalanx (fingertip) is secured by a pin at the joint and by an actuating bar that feeds through the proximal phalanx. First, remove the pair of bolts at the joint located furthest from the base, then use a small rod to push out the pin. Next, free the distal phalanx from the actuating bar by gently prying the rubber. Be careful not to stretch rubber excessively. 

## Attaching Mini-Gelsight
The base of the Mini-Gelsight is designed much like the original KG-2 distal phalanx. Attach the Mini-Gelsight to the actuating bar by the largest holes, then insert the pin through the joint and the Mini-Gelsight, and fasten the bolts to the pin. Plug both USBs into the wrist controller. The fingers are now ready to use.
